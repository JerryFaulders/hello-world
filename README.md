testing 1 2 3

So I have been coding for about 5 years now. I used to be a math teacher and a provate tutor.
I then went back to school and earned a second b.s. in comp sci. I worked for a very small company for 
3 years before the job ended. I am now learning more and looking for another job. I love math and I 
love coding but I have lived in a bit of a bubble. Joining GitHub is my way of trying to reach out
and join the coding community. Hello World.
